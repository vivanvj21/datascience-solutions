## Gmail App Password Setup

To enable email notifications for contact form submissions, you need to set up a Gmail App Password:

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification
1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Under "Signing in to Google", click **2-Step Verification**
3. Follow the setup process if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. In Google Account Security, click **App passwords**
2. Select **Mail** as the app
3. Select **Other (Custom name)** and enter "Vishnu Labs Contact Form"
4. Click **Generate**
5. Copy the 16-character password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 3: Configure Your Server
Replace `your_app_password_here` in `server/index.js` with your actual app password:

```javascript
const EMAIL_CONFIG = {
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'vishnupqw@gmail.com',
    pass: 'your_16_character_app_password' // Replace this
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Test Email Functionality
1. Start your server: `npm run server`
2. Submit a test contact form
3. Check your email at vishnupqw@gmail.com
